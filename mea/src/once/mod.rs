//! Asynchronous primitives for one-time async coordination.
//!
//! The module currently provides:
//!
//! - [`Once`]: An async synchronization primitive that ensures a one-time asynchronous operation
//!   runs at most once, even when called concurrently.
//! - [`OnceCell`]: A cell that can be written to only once, storing a value produced
//!   asynchronously.

/// A synchronization primitive which can be used to run a one-time async initialization.
///
/// Unlike [`std::sync::Once`], this type never blocks a thread. The provided closure must
/// produce a future and the future is awaited inside the primitive. Coordination happens
/// with asynchronous semaphores, which keeps the implementation runtime-agnostic.
///
/// This type also intentionally omits "poisoning" semantics. If an initialization future is
/// cancelled or panics, the attempt is abandoned and other tasks may retry the operation.
/// Encode partial-initialization detection in the future itself (e.g. return a `Result`)
/// when needed.
///
/// This type can only be constructed with Once::new().
///
/// See the [module level documentation](crate::once) for additional context.
///
/// # Examples
///
/// ```
/// # #[tokio::main]
/// # async fn main() {
/// use std::sync::atomic::AtomicUsize;
/// use std::sync::atomic::Ordering;
///
/// use mea::once::Once;
///
/// static ONCE: Once = Once::new();
/// static COUNTER: AtomicUsize = AtomicUsize::new(0);
///
/// let handle1 = tokio::spawn(async {
///     ONCE.call_once(async || {
///         COUNTER.fetch_add(1, Ordering::SeqCst);
///     })
///     .await;
/// });
///
/// let handle2 = tokio::spawn(async {
///     ONCE.call_once(async || {
///         COUNTER.fetch_add(1, Ordering::SeqCst);
///     })
///     .await;
/// });
///
/// handle1.await.unwrap();
/// handle2.await.unwrap();
///
/// // The counter is incremented only once, even though two tasks called `call_once`.
/// assert_eq!(COUNTER.load(Ordering::SeqCst), 1);
/// # }
