//! Asynchronous primitives for one-time async coordination.
//!
//! The module currently provides:
//!
//! - [`Once`]: A primitive that ensures a one-time asynchronous operation runs at most once, even
//!   when called concurrently.
//! - [`OnceCell`]: A cell that can be written to at most once, storing a value produced
//!   asynchronously.
